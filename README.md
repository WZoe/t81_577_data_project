## Visualizing World Happiness Level and Prediction

### Overview

This project utilized the World Happiness Report dataset which shows the happiness score along with several other metrics among different countries between 2015 to 2019. The project mainly does some visualization and analysis based on the dataset, and fits a model to predict the happiness score given some relevent data.
